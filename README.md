Welcome!
Hello! I am Stoinoiu Alexandru-Cristian, a second-year student at the University of Bucharest, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, studying CTI (Computer Science for Engineering). This is where I store the projects and experiments I work on during my studies.

About this repository
This repository contains various projects that I develop throughout the academic year. You'll find both course-related projects as well as personal projects or experiments with new technologies.

Repository structure
The repository is organized into directories, with each project having its own folder:
